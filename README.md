# TODo List
The creation of the ToDo List app involves utilizing Room for data storage and management, as well as RecyclerView for displaying and handling the list of items.

The addition of a new task can be initiated by utilizing a floating button. Each individual task within the list can be edited by swiping it to the right, and deletion can be performed by swiping it to the left.
